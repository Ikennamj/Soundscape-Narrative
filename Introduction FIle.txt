I collected almost all my sounds myself for my Sounscape Narrative. I recorded familiar sounds I heard during the day and put them together 
to make a "Day in the life" as a college student.
I have:
Alarm sounds
Brushing teeth sounds
Shower sounds
Beginning of class sounds 
End of class sounds 
Walking around campus sounds
The Eatery sounds
Homework sounds
TV sounds
